# Edgy Navigation

This app allows you to create a route from your current location to a destination shared from Google Maps. This route is then opened on Garmin Connect from which you can send it to your Garmin Device.

The route is generated by <a href="https://brouter.de/brouter-web/">BRouter</a> and is optimized for bicycles.

## Initial setup

Open the app and enter a Google Places API key. You can create a new key using the instructions <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/get-api-key">here</a>

This API is free for normal use cases, but you make too many requests, it becomes a paid service.

## Usage

Open Google Maps and select a location. Press the share button and select the Edgy Navigation app.
