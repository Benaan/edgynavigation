# Edgy Navigation

A app to create a route from your current location to a shared loction from Google Maps. This route is then opened on Garmin Connect where you can send it to your Garmin Device.

## Initial setup

This API is free for normal use cases, but if you need to make many requests, it becomes a paid service.
