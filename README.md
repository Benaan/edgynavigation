# edgynavigation

A app to create a route from your current location to a shared loction from Google Maps. This route is then opened on Garmin Connect where you can send it to your Garmin Device.

## Initial setup

Open the app and enter a Google Places api key. You can create a new key using the instructions <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/get-api-key">here</a><
This is a paid api when doing many requests. But in normal use cases should be free.

## Usage
